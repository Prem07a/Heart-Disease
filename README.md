# **Business Understanding**

### **Background**
* Ischaemic heart disease is the term given to heart problems caused by narrowed heart (coronary) arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.
* In 2022, 16.1% (20,322) of all medically certified deaths in Malaysia were caused by ischaemic heart disease.
* Primary cause of death for the 3 major races in Malaysia. Indians (21.1%), Malays (17.3%) and Chinese (14.7%).

### **Business Objective**
* Perform an in-depth analysis of ischaemic heart disease key risk factors to develop a prediction model for the purpose of early detection and diagnosis.

### **Business Success Criteria**
Provide a prediction model to detect probability of heart disease for high risk individuals based on risk factors selection for the following sectors:
* Electronic Healthcare Records
* Personal Health Monitoring Systems

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland & Long Beach V. 

It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, 
but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

Attribute Information:

01. age
02. sex
03. chest pain type (4 values)
04. resting blood pressure
05. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
06. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
07. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
08. maximum heart rate achieved
09. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
